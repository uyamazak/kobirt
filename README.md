# kobirt 🕊️
Tori-san will color the cities and towns of Saitama Prefecture.

In case you didn't know, Saitama Prefecture is adjacent to the north of Tokyo.

Saitama Prefecture is such an indescribable prefecture that it's [the subject of a movie](https://www.tondesaitama.com/).

It doesn't have a save function yet, so if you reload it, it'll disappear.

# How to play
This is not a game, it's a learning experience. But it may not help you in your life.

If you click on the bird, it will tell you. You might be able to click on your given city, but that would be very difficult. 

It is, after all, Saitama Prefecture.

# Why would Tori-san be coloring it?
You've usually never even heard of that cities and towns, let alone Saitama Prefecture.

The only one who knows them all is Torisan.

It seems they don't fly anymore, but they used to fly over Saitama Prefecture.

# Illustration
The illustration of Tori-san was drawn by [onoonoono5](https://twitter.com/onoonoono5) 

Apparently, it's about 16% kawaii than a real Tori-san.
